    <h1>   This is the first projest that we have created in APCSP using python turtle. We created a pollution psa that displays a meaningful message about pollution.</h1>
    <br>
    <h1>   We began the code by displaying the background of the ocean with sand and seaweed. 
	    Following this we had a fish swim accrose the screen to establish a lavish ocean enviorment. 
	    Then out of no where a plastic bag flotted down and rested on some seaweed. Sadly a turtle swims by and consumes the plastic bag resulting in its death.
		  Finaly text explaning what happend is desplayed across the screen and the message dont pollute is shown. </h1>
